# Workout Tracker
# Author: Jonathan Kay

iOS application to manage weight lifting routines.

Users will create named routines consisting of sets of exercises. When ready to record a workout the user creates
a new workout object with associated date and time. They select a routine for the workout, or begin a free workout.
Each exercise object in the routine contains information on how many repetitions were done, how many sets were done,
and how much weight was lifted per set. The user can record their body weight and any other relevant notes.

A history view will allow users to see the progression of their bodyweight, weight lifted in specific exercises, and
various other metadata.


Incomplete. Remaining TODO:
-Users can't set number of sets/reps during routine management
-History module with graph display for body weight and individual lifts
-Settings module
-General graphic design
-Metric measurements (kg vs lbs)
-Free workouts (no set routine, just add exercises as you go)
-Integration with social media fitness services (e.g. fitocracy)
